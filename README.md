# Wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter Data

The goal of this project was to wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. In order to exhibit what has been taught in the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program, this project was given, where we wrangle data from the WeRateDog Twitter account using Python, documented in a jupyter notebook (wrangle_act.ipynb).
